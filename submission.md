title: "CI2023: Paper submission guidelines"

The subject matter should be selected with Climate Informatics in mind: either presenting algorithms that could have potential applications in geosciences or datasets and physical problems that pose a specific problem in geosciences are both welcome, but ideally should combine machine/deep learning and advanced statistics with a geophysical issue.

This year’s conference offers two tracks for submissions:

__a) Full paper submission__

The accepted full paper will be considered to be included in an open-access, peer-reviewed special collection on the journal [Environmental Data Science](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science) tied to the conference.

The paper should be no longer than 8 pages, not including references, using the templates provided by Environmental Data Science (for more information, see the [journal’s instructions](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science/information/instructions-for-authors) for authors).

__b) Extended abstract submission__

No template is provided and no particular formatting is required, but extended abstract should contain sufficient information for the reviewer to determine the quality of the work, including data and methods used as well as a summary of results. The extended abstract should be no longer than 2 pages, including the most relevant references or figures (not required). You can present preliminary results.

All submissions should be made through the [CMT portal](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ClimateInformatics2023/) by the deadline of _~~26th January 2023 (AoE)~~ (Extended: 1st February 2023 ([AoE](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe))))_.

The papers will be peer-reviewed and decisions about acceptance will be made by ~~23 February 2023~~ 27 February 2023.
