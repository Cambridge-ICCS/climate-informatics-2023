## Travel

If possible, we strongly encourage participants to travel by low-carbon means (e.g., across land). We have deliberately scheduled CI2023 just before the [EGU General Assembly 2023](https://egu23.eu/) in Vienna so that participants coming from outside of Europe can combine trips and reduce air travel.

### Train

Cambridge is well connected by train to the rest of the UK and Europe.

The main station is located about one mile from the city centre (around 20 minutes on foot). There is another train station, Cambridge North, around 2 miles north of the city. See National rail enquiries for train timetables and to book tickets. [thetrainline.com](http://thetrainline.com) is also a good resource for querying timings.

There is a taxi rank outside the main Cambridge station and buses run frequently between the station and city centre (to/from Emmanuel Street/St Andrew's Street) although it is also quite walkable. The 'Universal' bus service route (see above) also picks up/sets down at Cambridge train station.

### From London

From London, the quickest route goes from London Kings Cross to Cambridge, taking roughly 50 minutes. There are also trains from London St. Pancras, taking roughly 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes. London St. Pancras and London Kings Cross are next to each other separated by a road, so a very short walk between them.

A good website for planning train journeys is [Transport for London](https://tfl.gov.uk/plan-a-journey/). An alternate route which is longer but cheaper to get to London Kings Cross is to take the Piccadilly line all the way from Heathrow to Kings Cross St. Pancras.

### From Continental Europe

Cambridge is well connected to rest of Europe via the [Eurostar](https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en) which arrives to London St. Pancras. The train is very comfortable and quick (e.g., 2 hours from Paris). It is then easy to get the train from London St. Pancras directly to Cambridge, or by walking across the road to London Kings Cross for the fast train (see above).


## Bus

In addition, [National Express coaches](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en) regularly run from major cities and Stansted, Luton, Heathrow and Gatwick airports to the city centre of Cambridge. National Express coaches usually stop on Parkside, next to Parker’s Piece in the city centre.

Local bus services usually run to/from Cambridge bus station in Drummer Street, and/or the adjacent Emmanuel Street and St Andrew’s Street. There are frequent buses from the railway station to the city centre.
The 'U' / Universal bus service bus service runs from Eddington, next to the Madingley Road Park and Ride site, through to our Biomedical Campus from Monday to Saturday, and from Eddington to Cambridge Railway Station on Sundays.

## Car

If you’re planning on driving to Cambridge, we strongly recommend that you use the Park & Ride scheme. Parking in the city centre is extremely limited (with no parking at the colleges) and several city centre roads have restricted access with penalties for using them.
Those travelling from the north can also use the Guided Busway Park & Ride services (follow signs for Longstanton P&R from Junction 29 of the A14).
Disabled parking is available in the city’s car parks and on some streets. Please check in advance with the Cambridge Tourist Information Centre or visit www.cambridge.gov.uk/parking.

## Air travel

The nearest airports to Cambridge are Stansted (30 miles) and Luton (40 miles). London Heathrow has the most routes from non-EU destinations. There's a direct train link to Cambridge from Stansted and Gatwick airports, and Heathrow airport is also easily accessible by train (via London King's Cross/London St Pancras) see below and coach (bus).

A good route to take from the airport is the Heathrow Express to Paddington then the tube (metro) to Kings Cross / St. Pancras
(see [Train](#Train) above).

## VISA

If you need an invitation letter for VISA purposes then please do [ask the local organisers](mailto:iccs@maths.cam.ac.uk).
