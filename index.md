## 12<sup>th</sup> International Conference on Climate Informatics

### About the Conference

The Institute of Computing for Climate Science at the University of Cambridge
is pleased to announce the 12th International Conference on Climate Informatics, which will be hosted at
the university in April 2022.

The Climate Informatics conference series aims to bring together
researchers and users across different disciplines and sectors to
forge international collaboration between climate science, data
science, and computer science, share state-of-art developments in
climate data and informatics, and accelerate the rate of discovery in
climate science and adaptation of climate applications.

Climate Informatics is an open community interested in research
combining climate science with approaches from statistics, machine
learning and data mining. We hope to stimulate discussion of new
ideas, foster new collaborations, grow the community, and thus
accelerate discovery across disciplinary boundaries.
